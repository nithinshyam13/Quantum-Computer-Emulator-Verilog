Abstract:
Unlike traditional computing, quantum computing takes advantage of the quantum phenomena where 
there are no discrete states (0:OFF and 1:ON), but states which are probabilistic in nature. The value of a 
qubit is based on the principle of superposition and quantum entanglement, and hence nondeterministic.
Quantum gates are used to manipulate qubits whose ways are fundamentally different from logic gates.
Its state is known only during measurement.

The work presented is an emulation of a quantum computer in hardware of qubit lengths 1 to 4. The 
operations performed by quantum gates on qubits are characterized using complex number matrix 
multiplication. The design employs 2 Floating Point Multiply-And-Add units, one for the calculation of the 
real part and another for the complex part. A single multiplication involving two complex numbers 
consumes 2 clock cycles. Control of the matrix multiplications is handled using row and column counters.
Computations with multiple operator/gate matrices can be handled. A clock period of 40ns and utilized 
area of 47574.8 um2
is achieved.
